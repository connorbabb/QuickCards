# Overview

This is a flashcard app that allows the user to add, delete cards to a personal deck. Once the user creates flashcards the user can press the test button that randomly selects a card a displays the term and waits for the user to press the show answer button. When the program is ended the apps does not keep the deck of flashcards.

I created this app because I know that a lot of software development happens on mobile, specifically with kotlin. So I wanted to gain some experience with that. I wanted to get affiliated with user input.

# Development Environment

I used youtube tutorials, online tutorials, and the use of AI to build the app.

I used kotlin and Jetpack Compose inside of the Android studio app to create this.
